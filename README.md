# Py-Project__Prettify-Folder
This program helps user to prettify a folder. User have to mention the target folder first, an optional text file containing the file names for exclusion, and an optional file extension such as *.jpg for renaming with numbers. The program makes all files resided in the specified folder title case without even touching the files mentioned in the option exclusion file separated by new line.
